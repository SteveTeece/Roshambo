Graphic version of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in Java.  Play against Bart or Lisa Simpson.

This is my first Java app, and was written as part of the Certificate IV in Programming course with NSW TAFE Digital.

The Bart and Lisa Simpson characters were created by Matt Groening. No violation of copyright is intended.
